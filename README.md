# Unity Clock
A class to track total play time in Unity.

##Â How to use

Simply create an empty or attach the script to an existing GameObject, then in your script make a reference to the clock like the following:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using Shade;

public class Game : MonoBehaviour
{
    public Clock clock;

    // Start is called before the first frame update
    void Start()
    {
        Debug.Log("Total play time of " + clock.time + " seconds.");
    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update()
    {
        Debug.Log("Total play time of " + clock.time + " seconds.");
    }
}
```

## How it works

It is storing the total play time (Clock_Lifespan) in the PlayerPrefs upon each LateUpdate. Also, when you quit the application, it stores a reference to that moment, so it can convert it back into seconds upon next start and add it to the lifespan.
